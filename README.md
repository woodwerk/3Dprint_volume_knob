# 3Dprint_volume_knob
A combo project - a 3D printed base and knob, containing a rotary encoder and Arduino Micro Pro

This project was inspired by model files, schematics and code shared on the [Prusa printers site](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/3592-media-control-volume-knob-abstract-body). The instructions provided there are fairly complete, so limiting content here to photos of the finished product and the inclusion of a shell for the Arduino that was also printed and then super-glued to the base. A set of small self-adhesive rubber button feed were added to the bottom of the assembly so it stays put on my desk.
